## üìå Overview  

This project is a **Full-Stack Student Management System** built with the **MERN stack**.  
It allows administrators and teachers to manage students, track attendance, and secure access through **role-based authentication**.  

Key aspects of the system include:  
- A clean and responsive **React frontend** with dynamic dashboards  
- A robust **Node.js & Express backend** with secured APIs  
- Persistent data storage in **MongoDB** with schema-driven design  
- **Authentication & Authorization** using JWT tokens and bcrypt password hashing  
- Modern UI/UX powered by **Tailwind CSS** and enhanced with interactive features  

## ‚ö° Technical Highlights

- Built with **MERN Stack** (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js)  
- Secured with **bcrypt** for password hashing & **JWT** for authentication  
- Input validation handled using **express-validator**  
- Styled with **Tailwind CSS** for responsive and modern UI design  
- Version controlled with **Git & GitHub** for collaboration and source management

## üöÄ Final Thoughts  
This project started as a simple React CRUD app but evolved into a **secure, scalable, and user-friendly MERN application**.  

It demonstrates:  
- Handling complex UI rendering with React.  
- Building and securing APIs with Express & MongoDB.  
- Implementing real-world security (bcrypt, JWT, sanitization).  
- Enhancing user experience with responsive UI + alerts.
